### Linear Regression to Predict MPG (Deliverable 1)

INSERT: linear image

- Which variable/coefficents provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? why or why not?

### Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils (Deliverable 2)

Total_Summary Results:

INSERT: total sum image

Lot_Summary Results:

INSERT lot sum image

- design specs for mechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 PSI.

Does the current mfg data meet this design spec for all mfg lots in total and each lot individualy? why or why not?

### T-Tests on Suspension Coils (Deliverable 3)

PSI results for ALL mfg lots compared to population mean of 1,500 PSI:

INSERT all ttest image

PSI results for Lot 1 compared to mean of 1,500:

INSERT lot1 ttest image

PSI results for Lot 2 compared to mean of 1,500:

INSERT lot2 ttest image

PSI results for Lot 3 compared to mean of 1,500:

INSERT lot3 ttest image
